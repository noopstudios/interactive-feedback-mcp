# Interactive Feedback MCP

Developed by FÃ¡bio Ferreira ([@fabiomlferreira](https://x.com/fabiomlferreira)).

Simple [MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to enable a human-in-the-loop workflow in AI-assisted development tools like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com). This server allows you to run commands, view their output, and provide textual feedback directly to the AI. It is also compatible with [Cline](https://cline.bot) and [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com).

## Prompt Engineering

For the best results, add the following to your custom prompt in your AI assistant, you should add it on a rule or directly in the prompt (e.g., Cursor):

> Whenever you want to ask a question, always call the MCP `interactive_feedback`.  
> Whenever youâ€™re about to complete a user request, call the MCP `interactive_feedback` instead of simply ending the process.
> Keep calling MCP until the userâ€™s feedback is empty, then end the request.

This will ensure your AI assistant uses this MCP server to request user feedback before marking the task as completed.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Use This?
By guiding the assistant to check in with the user instead of branching out into speculative, high-cost tool calls, this module can drastically reduce the number of premium requests (e.g., OpenAI tool invocations) on platforms like Cursor. In some cases, it helps consolidate what would be up to 25 tool calls into a single, feedback-aware request â€” saving resources and improving performance.

## Configuration

This MCP server uses Qt's `QSettings` to store configuration on a per-project basis. This includes:
*   The command to run.
*   Whether to execute the command automatically on the next startup for that project (see "Execute automatically on next run" checkbox).
*   The visibility state (shown/hidden) of the command section (this is saved immediately when toggled).
*   Window geometry and state (general UI preferences).

These settings are typically stored in platform-specific locations (e.g., registry on Windows, plist files on macOS, configuration files in `~/.config` or `~/.local/share` on Linux) under an organization name "FabioFerreira" and application name "InteractiveFeedbackMCP", with a unique group for each project directory.

The "Save Configuration" button in the UI primarily saves the current command typed into the command input field and the state of the "Execute automatically on next run" checkbox for the active project. The visibility of the command section is saved automatically when you toggle it. General window size and position are saved when the application closes.

## Installation (Cursor)

![Instalation on Cursor](https://github.com/noopstudios/interactive-feedback-mcp/blob/main/.github/cursor-example.jpg?raw=true)

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.11 or newer.
    *   [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python package manager). Install it with:
        *   Windows: `pip install uv`
        *   Linux/Mac: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
2.  **Get the code:**
    *   Clone this repository:
        `git clone https://github.com/noopstudios/interactive-feedback-mcp.git`
    *   Or download the source code.
3.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    *   `cd path/to/interactive-feedback-mcp`
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   `uv sync` (this creates a virtual environment and installs packages)
5.  **Run the MCP Server:**
    *   `uv run server.py`
6.  **Configure in Cursor:**
    *   Cursor typically allows specifying custom MCP servers in its settings. You'll need to point Cursor to this running server. The exact mechanism might vary, so consult Cursor's documentation for adding custom MCPs.
    *   **Manual Configuration (e.g., via `mcp.json`)**
        **Remember to change the `/Users/fabioferreira/Dev/scripts/interactive-feedback-mcp` path to the actual path where you cloned the repository on your system.**

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "interactive-feedback-mcp": {
              "command": "uv",
              "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/Users/fabioferreira/Dev/scripts/interactive-feedback-mcp",
                "run",
                "server.py"
              ],
              "timeout": 600,
              "autoApprove": [
                "interactive_feedback"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    *   You might use a server identifier like `interactive-feedback-mcp` when configuring it in Cursor.

### For Cline / Windsurf

Similar setup principles apply. You would configure the server command (e.g., `uv run server.py` with the correct `--directory` argument pointing to the project directory) in the respective tool's MCP settings, using `interactive-feedback-mcp` as the server identifier.

## Development

To run the server in development mode with a web interface for testing:

```sh
uv run fastmcp dev server.py
```

This will open a web interface and allow you to interact with the MCP tools for testing.

## Available tools

Here's an example of how the AI assistant would call the `interactive_feedback` tool:

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
  <server_name>interactive-feedback-mcp</server_name>
  <tool_name>interactive_feedback</tool_name>
  <arguments>
    {
      "project_directory": "/path/to/your/project",
      "summary": "I've implemented the changes you requested and refactored the main module."
    }
  </arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

## Language Support

The Interactive Feedback MCP supports multiple languages through a flexible JSON-based configuration system. Languages are automatically detected from the `languages/` directory.

### Available Languages

| Language Code | Language Name | File |
|---------------|---------------|------|
| `en` | English | `languages/en.json` |
| `zh` | ä¸­æ–‡ (Chinese) | `languages/zh.json` |
| `fr` | FranÃ§ais (French) | `languages/fr.json` |

### Language Configuration Structure

Each language file follows this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Language Display Name",
  "window_title": "Window title text",
  "show_command_section": "Show Command Section",
  "hide_command_section": "Hide Command Section",
  "command": "Command",
  "working_directory": "Working directory",
  "run": "&Run",
  "stop": "Sto&p",
  "execute_automatically": "Execute automatically on next run",
  "save_configuration": "&Save Configuration",
  "console": "Console",
  "clear": "&Clear",
  "feedback": "Feedback",
  "feedback_placeholder": "Enter your feedback here (Ctrl+Enter to submit)",
  "send_feedback": "&Send Feedback (Ctrl+Enter)",
  "contact_info": "Contact information HTML",
  "configuration_saved": "Configuration saved for this project.\n",
  "error_running_command": "Error running command: {error}\n",
  "command_prompt": "$ {command}\n",
  "language": "Language",
  "language_changed": "Language changed message.\n",
  "please_enter_command": "Please enter a command to run\n",
  "argparse_description": "Run the feedback UI",
  "argparse_project_directory_help": "The project directory to run the command in",
  "argparse_prompt_help": "The prompt to show to the user",
  "argparse_output_file_help": "Path to save the feedback result as JSON",
  "default_prompt": "I implemented the changes you requested.",
  "logs_collected": "Logs collected",
  "feedback_received": "Feedback received",
  "argparse_language_help": "Interface language, automatically detects available languages"
}
```

### Adding New Languages

To add support for a new language:

1. Create a new JSON file in the `languages/` directory (e.g., `languages/es.json` for Spanish)
2. Include the `name` field with the language's display name
3. Translate all the text keys according to the structure above
4. The language will be automatically detected and available in the language selector

### Usage

You can specify the language when running the application:

```bash
# Use English (default)
python feedback_ui.py --language en

# Use Chinese
python feedback_ui.py --language zh

# Use French
python feedback_ui.py --language fr
```

The language preference is automatically saved and restored between sessions.
